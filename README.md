# Salvare: A Unified Platform for Saving Resources

## Project Overview
*This is the project page for our fifth-semester software engineering project at CSEDU. The following documentation is required for the completion of the project.*

Salvare is an innovative mobile application designed to help users save, organize, and share various online resources such as links, articles, images, and videos. In an era of information overload, Salvare aims to address the challenges of resource management, making it easier for users to access and collaborate on important content.

## Project Rationale

### Background
As online activity increases, the challenge of managing vast information grows. Users often face several key issues:
- Losing track of online content previously encountered
- Insufficient search tools to pinpoint specific saved resources
- Lack of accessible filters (such as tags) for effective organization
- Difficulty in saving multiple links simultaneously
- Challenges in sharing resources without messaging platforms

Salvare seeks to provide a cohesive solution for saving and accessing online content, incorporating collaborative features that enhance resource sharing among users.

### Scope
Salvare is not just another resource-saving tool; it aims to fill the gaps left by existing implementations. By offering advanced features like:
- Regex-based search
- Tagging and batch link addition
- Collaborative baskets for group sharing

Salvare is designed for both power users and casual users, ensuring ease of use without overwhelming complexity.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a user-friendly dashboard on a mobile application as the central hub for saving and viewing content.
- Support multiple users on the same instance with managed authorizations for collaborative resource sharing.
- Provide advanced filtering options for power users, including regex matching, content type, date range, domains, and tags.
- Enable the parsing of multiple links from any text input.
- Offer insights and statistics about the user's stored content.

## Cost and Benefit

### Project Cost
- Hardware and software for running, testing, and debugging the project.
- An always-on database for data storage and authentication flow.
- Time and commitment from developers.

### Project Benefit
- A one-tap solution for resource-saving, organizing, and collaborating.
- Opportunities to implement object-oriented design patterns.
- Learning experiences related to software engineering conventions in large-scale projects.
- Insights into software management and maintainability, guided by experienced supervisors.

## Project Approach
If successfully implemented, Salvare has the potential to significantly enhance user productivity and simplify online resource sharing through its Android application.

## Project Risks
- **Inaccurate Estimations:** Setting unrealistic goals may lead to unmet expectations.
- **Inexperience:** Lack of experience in large-scale software development may cause oversights.
- **Changing Requirements:** Frequent changes in requirements can create confusion and waste time.
- **Technical Risks:** Dependency on external libraries can introduce bugs beyond direct control.
- **Poor Productivity:** Long project timelines can lead to decreased motivation and productivity.
